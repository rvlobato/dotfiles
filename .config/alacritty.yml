# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 105
    lines: 35
    # Window position (changes require restart)
    #
    # Specified in number of pixels.
    # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
    #position:
    #  x: 0
    #  y: 0
    # Window padding (changes require restart)
    #
    # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
    # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
    #padding:
    #  x: 0
    #  y: 0
    # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
    #dynamic_padding: false
    # Window decorations
    #
    # Values for `decorations`:
    #     - full: Borders and title bar
    #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
    #
    # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
    #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
    #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar
    # buttons
    # decorations: full
    # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
    #
    # Values for `startup_mode`:
    #   - Windowed
    #   - Maximized
    #   - Fullscreen
    #
    # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
    #   - SimpleFullscreen
    #startup_mode: Windowed
    # Window title
    # title: Terminal
    # Window class (Linux/BSD only):
    #class:
    # Application instance name
    #instance: Alacritty
    # General application class
    #general: Alacritty
    # GTK theme variant (Linux/BSD only)
    #
    # Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`.
    # Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.
    # gtk_theme_variant: dark
    #scrolling:
    # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
    # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
    #history: 10000
    # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
    # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
    #multiplier: 3
    # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
    #auto_scroll: false
    # Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
    #
    # This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
    #
    # Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
    # To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
    # change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.

    # Font configuration
    #font:
    # Normal (roman) font face
    #normal:
    # Font family
    #
    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) Menlo
    #   - (Linux/BSD) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    #family: monospace
    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Regular
    # Bold font face
    #bold:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    #family: monospace
    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Bold
    # Italic font face
    #italic:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    #family: monospace
    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Italic
    # Bold italic font face

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    #style: Bold Italic
  # Point size
  #size: 11.0
  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  #offset:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  #glyph_offset:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0
  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  #use_thin_strokes: true
# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
#draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true
# Colors (Darkside)
